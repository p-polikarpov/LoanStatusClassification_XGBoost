### Loan Status Classification_XGBoost

Scientific research project aimed at predicting loan status based on the data of individual borrowers. The project uses a public dataset that has been downloaded from Kaggle using Kaggle API. 95% accuracy (ROC-AUC) on test data has been achieved by means of XGBoost model with K-fold cross-validation. The attached .ipynb solution file follows the plan below:

1. EDA, outlier detection and preprocessing

2. XGBoost application and hyperparameters' tuning

3. Feature importance and test data inspection
